# Yelp::Fusion

This is a Ruby Gem for the Yelp API. It'll simplify the process of consuming data from the Yelp API for developers using Ruby. The library encompasses both Search and Business API functions.

This library is in Beta and should be used for testing purposes only.

Please remember to read and follow the [Terms of Use](https://www.yelp.com/developers/api_terms) and [display requirements](https://www.yelp.com/developers/display_requirements) before creating your applications.


## Installation

Add this line to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yelp-fusion', '0.2.1-beta'
```

Add this line to your Ruby appliation's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yelp-fusion', require: 'yelp/fusion'
```



And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yelp-fusion --pre

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The gem uses a client model to query against the API. You create and configure a client with your API keys and make requests through that.

```ruby
require 'yelp/fusion'

client = Yelp::Fusion::Client.new(YOUR_API_KEY)
```

Alternatively, you can also globally configure the client using a configure
block, and access a client singleton using `Yelp::Fusion.client`.  If you intend to
use the gem with Rails, the client should be configured in an initializer.

```ruby
require 'yelp/fusion'

configuration = Yelp.client.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
end

configuration.search('San Francisco', { term: 'food' })
```
After creating the client you're able to make requests to either the Search, Business, Phone, Review, Match, and Transaction API. Note: you must have an API key. If you need any keys sign up and get access from [http://www.yelp.com/developers](http://www.yelp.com/developers).

### [Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search)

Once you have a client you can use ``#search`` to make a request to the Search API.

```ruby
client.search('San Francisco')
```

You can also pass in general params and locale options to the method as hashes

```ruby
params = { term: 'food',
           limit: 3,
           category_filter: 'discgolf'
         }

locale = { lang: 'fr' }

client.search('San Francisco', params, locale)
```
Key names and options for params and locale match the documented names on the [Yelp Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search)

Additionally there is one more search methods for searching by [geographical coordinates](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search):

```ruby
# coordinates
coordinates = { latitude: 37.7577, longitude: -122.4376 }
client.search_by_coordinates(coordinates, params)
```

### [Business API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business)

To use the Business API after you have a client you just need to call ``#business`` with a business id

```ruby
client.business('lJAGnYzku5zSaLnQ_T6_GQ')
```

### [Phone Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search_phone)

To use the Phone Search API after you have a client you just need to call ``#phone_search`` with a phone number and make sure you use the country code.

```ruby
client.phone_search('+15555555555')
```

### [Review Details API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews)

To find all of the reviews for a business, use ``#review`` with a business ID.

```ruby
client.review('lJAGnYzku5zSaLnQ_T6_GQ')
```

### [Transaction Details API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/transaction_search)

To find all of the reviews for a business, use ``#transaction`` with ``'deliver'`` and a business ID.

```ruby
client.transaction_search('delivery', {location: 'San Francisco'})
```

### [Match Details API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_match)

To find all of the reviews for a business, use ``#match`` with a business ID.

```ruby
client.match({name: 'swissbakers', address1: '168 Western Ave', city: 'allston', state: 'MA', country: 'US'})
```

## Responses

Responses from the API are all parsed and converted into Ruby objects. You're able to access information using dot-notation

```ruby
## search
response = client.search('San Francisco')

response.businesses
# [<Business 1>, <Business 2>, ...]

response.businesses[0].name
# "Kim Makoi, DC"

response.businesses[0].rating
# 5.0


## business
response = client.business('lJAGnYzku5zSaLnQ_T6_GQ')

response.business.name
# Yelp

response.business.categories
# [["Local Flavor", "localflavor"], ["Mass Media", "massmedia"]]
```

For specific response values check out the docs for the [Search API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api#rValue), the [Business API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/business#rValue), the [Match API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_match), the [Phone API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search_phone), the [Review API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews), and the [Transaction API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/transaction_search)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
